Orig. Deployment - September 22, 2018

# Idea
I wanted to learn more about icons important and influential to the LGBTQ community, so I decided to use this as the theme for this project. The icons I listed first are some of my favorite. Hope you enjoy!

# User Guide

Here's how it works:

- You have an initial set of buttons to click on to generate GIFs. They are people iconic in the LGBTQ community
- When you click on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
- When you click one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If you click the gif again, it will stop playing.
- Under every gif, its rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).
- Have fun!

The game uses basic AJAX methods, so good for a great first run at using APIs!
